"""Checks of the finished output of the menu builder.

The output is checked by the invitations' `check_output` without a media
directory: its allow-list then holds the layout of the menu, a directory
`<token>/` with `index.html` for every page and `assets/` with the files of
the code.  Every local address of a page, a link as well as a resource, has
to lie under the base path and name a file of the output: a page that leads
to another part of the site is an error.

On top of that, `assets/` holds `app.css`, `app.js` and `favicon.svg` and
nothing else (any other file of the code that would be published, a font or
a note, is a problem), no element of a page may carry a `style` attribute,
inside an inline SVG as well: the styles of the pages live in
`assets/app.css` alone (the invitations' checks look at the URLs of a
`style` attribute, not at the attribute itself), a page links only to its
own parts: every `<a>` and `<area>` has an `href` of the form `#<id>`, the
id of an element of the same page (the invitations' checks let a fragment
pass without looking at its target, and a link to another page of the
output would resolve), and no file holds the token of a record, in any
letter case, its own page included: a token is only the name of the
directory of its page.

Every problem is reported in one `OutputError`, at most
`MAX_REPORTED_PROBLEMS` lines as in the invitations.  The messages never
quote the text of a page nor a token, and the directories of the pages are
shown as `…`: they are named after the tokens.
