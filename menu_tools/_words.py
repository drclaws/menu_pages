"""The words the build joins with seat numbers, names and counts.

A page fragment holds every fixed text of the interface ("Staff version",
"No.", "Paired with", "You", "+1", "[name]" and so on).  The texts here are
the ones the build has to put together with numbers or names before they
reach a fragment: "Seats 8 & 9", "Olga — blue, your guest — dark red", "If
chosen by seat 3 (no nuts) - ...", "14 guests".  One place for all of them,
so that the wording of the menu is easy to change.

Seat numbers are always listed in ascending order.  Standard library only.
